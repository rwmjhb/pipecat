# Changelog

All notable changes to **pipecat** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.28] - 2024-06-05

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with `SileroVADAnalyzer` that would cause memory to keep
  growing indefinitely.

## [0.0.27] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- Added `DailyTransport.participants()` and `DailyTransport.participant_counts()`.

## [0.0.26] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- Added `OpenAITTSService`.

- Allow passing `output_format` and `model_id` to `CartesiaTTSService` to change
  audio sample format and the model to use.

- Added `DailyRESTHelper` which helps you create Daily rooms and tokens in an
  easy way.

- `PipelineTask` now has a `has_finished()` method to indicate if the task has
  completed. If a task is never ran `has_finished()` will return False.

- `PipelineRunner` now supports SIGTERM. If received, the runner will be
  canceled.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `BaseInputTransport` and `BaseOutputTransport` where
  stopping push tasks before pushing `EndFrame` frames could cause the bots to
  get stuck.

- Fixed an error closing local audio transports.

- Fixed an issue with Deepgram TTS that was introduced in the previous release.

- Fixed `AnthropicLLMService` interruptions. If an interruption occurred, a
  `user` message could be appended after the previous `user` message. Anthropic
  does not allow that because it requires alternate `user` and `assistant`
  messages.

### Performance

- The `BaseInputTransport` does not pull audio frames from sub-classes any
  more. Instead, sub-classes now push audio frames into a queue in the base
  class. Also, `DailyInputTransport` now pushes audio frames every 20ms instead
  of 10ms.

- Remove redundant camera input thread from `DailyInputTransport`. This should
  improve performance a little bit when processing participant videos.

- Load Cartesia voice on startup.

## [0.0.25] - 2024-05-31

### Added

- Added WebsocketServerTransport. This will create a websocket server and will
  read messages coming from a client. The messages are serialized/deserialized
  with protobufs. See `examples/websocket-server` for a detailed example.

- Added function calling (LLMService.register_function()). This will allow the
  LLM to call functions you have registered when needed. For example, if you
  register a function to get the weather in Los Angeles and ask the LLM about
  the weather in Los Angeles, the LLM will call your function.
  See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling

- Added new `LangchainProcessor`.

- Added Cartesia TTS support (https://cartesia.ai/)

### Fixed

- Fixed SileroVAD frame processor.

- Fixed an issue where `camera_out_enabled` would cause the highg CPU usage if
  no image was provided.

### Performance

- Removed unnecessary audio input tasks.

## [0.0.24] - 2024-05-29

### Added

- Exposed `on_dialin_ready` for Daily transport SIP endpoint handling. This
  notifies when the Daily room SIP endpoints are ready. This allows integrating
  with third-party services like Twilio.

- Exposed Daily transport `on_app_message` event.

- Added Daily transport `on_call_state_updated` event.

- Added Daily transport `start_recording()`, `stop_recording` and
  `stop_dialout`.

### Changed

- Added `PipelineParams`. This replaces the `allow_interruptions` argument in
  `PipelineTask` and will allow future parameters in the future.

- Fixed Deepgram Aura TTS base_url and added ErrorFrame reporting.

- GoogleLLMService `api_key` argument is now mandatory.

### Fixed

- Daily tranport `dialin-ready` doesn't not block anymore and it now handles
  timeouts.

- Fixed AzureLLMService.

## [0.0.23] - 2024-05-23

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue handling Daily transport `dialin-ready` event.

## [0.0.22] - 2024-05-23

### Added

- Added Daily transport `start_dialout()` to be able to make phone or SIP calls.
  See https://reference-python.daily.co/api_reference.html#daily.CallClient.start_dialout

- Added Daily transport support for dial-in use cases.

- Added Daily transport events: `on_dialout_connected`, `on_dialout_stopped`,
  `on_dialout_error` and `on_dialout_warning`.  See
  https://reference-python.daily.co/api_reference.html#daily.EventHandler

## [0.0.21] - 2024-05-22

### Added

- Added vision support to Anthropic service.

- Added `WakeCheckFilter` which allows you to pass information downstream only
  if you say a certain phrase/word.

### Changed

- `Filter` has been renamed to `FrameFilter` and it's now under
  `processors/filters`.

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic service to use new frame types.

- Fixed an issue in `LLMUserResponseAggregator` and `UserResponseAggregator`
  that would cause frames after a brief pause to not be pushed to the LLM.

- Clear the audio output buffer if we are interrupted.

- Re-add exponential smoothing after volume calculation. This makes sure the
  volume value being used doesn't fluctuate so much.

## [0.0.20] - 2024-05-22

### Added

- In order to improve interruptions we now compute a loudness level using
  [pyloudnorm](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/pyloudnorm). The audio coming
  WebRTC transports (e.g. Daily) have an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) algorithm
  applied to the signal, however we don't do that on our local PyAudio
  signals. This means that currently incoming audio from PyAudio is kind of
  broken. We will fix it in future releases.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `StartInterruptionFrame` would cause
  `LLMUserResponseAggregator` to push the accumulated text causing the LLM
  respond in the wrong task. The `StartInterruptionFrame` should not trigger any
  new LLM response because that would be spoken in a different task.

- Fixed an issue where tasks and threads could be paused because the executor
  didn't have more tasks available. This was causing issues when cancelling and
  recreating tasks during interruptions.

## [0.0.19] - 2024-05-20

### Changed

- `LLMUserResponseAggregator` and `LLMAssistantResponseAggregator` internal
  messages are now exposed through the `messages` property.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `LLMAssistantResponseAggregator` was not accumulating the
  full response but short sentences instead. If there's an interruption we only
  accumulate what the bot has spoken until now in a long response as well.

## [0.0.18] - 2024-05-20

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue in `DailyOuputTransport` where transport messages were not
  being sent.

## [0.0.17] - 2024-05-19

### Added

- Added `google.generativeai` model support, including vision. This new `google`
  service defaults to using `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`. Example in
  `examples/foundational/12a-describe-video-gemini-flash.py`.

- Added vision support to `openai` service. Example in
  `examples/foundational/12a-describe-video-gemini-flash.py`.

- Added initial interruptions support. The assistant contexts (or aggregators)
  should now be placed after the output transport. This way, only the completed
  spoken context is added to the assistant context.

- Added `VADParams` so you can control voice confidence level and others.

- `VADAnalyzer` now uses an exponential smoothed volume to improve speech
  detection. This is useful when voice confidence is high (because there's
  someone talking near you) but volume is low.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where TTSService was not pushing TextFrames downstream.

- Fixed issues with Ctrl-C program termination.

- Fixed an issue that was causing `StopTaskFrame` to actually not exit the
  `PipelineTask`.

## [0.0.16] - 2024-05-16

### Fixed

- `DailyTransport`: don't publish camera and audio tracks if not enabled.

- Fixed an issue in `BaseInputTransport` that was causing frames pushed
  downstream not pushed in the right order.

## [0.0.15] - 2024-05-15

### Fixed

- Quick hot fix for receiving `DailyTransportMessage`.

## [0.0.14] - 2024-05-15

### Added

- Added `DailyTransport` event `on_participant_left`.

- Added support for receiving `DailyTransportMessage`.

### Fixed

- Images are now resized to the size of the output camera. This was causing
  images not being displayed.

- Fixed an issue in `DailyTransport` that would not allow the input processor to
  shutdown if no participant ever joined the room.

- Fixed base transports start and stop. In some situation processors would halt
  or not shutdown properly.

## [0.0.13] - 2024-05-14

### Changed

- `MoondreamService` argument `model_id` is now `model`.

- `VADAnalyzer` arguments have been renamed for more clarity.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with `DailyInputTransport` and `DailyOutputTransport` that
  could cause some threads to not start properly.

- Fixed `STTService`. Add `max_silence_secs` and `max_buffer_secs` to handle
  better what's being passed to the STT service. Also add exponential smoothing
  to the RMS.

- Fixed `WhisperSTTService`. Add `no_speech_prob` to avoid garbage output text.

## [0.0.12] - 2024-05-14

### Added

- Added `DailyTranscriptionSettings` to be able to specify transcription
  settings much easier (e.g. language).

### Other

- Updated `simple-chatbot` with Spanish.

- Add missing dependencies in some of the examples.

## [0.0.11] - 2024-05-13

### Added

- Allow stopping pipeline tasks with new `StopTaskFrame`.

### Changed

- TTS, STT and image generation service now use `AsyncGenerator`.

### Fixed

- `DailyTransport`: allow registering for participant transcriptions even if
  input transport is not initialized yet.

### Other

- Updated `storytelling-chatbot`.

## [0.0.10] - 2024-05-13

### Added

- Added Intel GPU support to `MoondreamService`.

- Added support for sending transport messages (e.g. to communicate with an app
  at the other end of the transport).

- Added `FrameProcessor.push_error()` to easily send an `ErrorFrame` upstream.

### Fixed

- Fixed Azure services (TTS and image generation).

### Other

- Updated `simple-chatbot`, `moondream-chatbot` and `translation-chatbot`
  examples.

## [0.0.9] - 2024-05-12

### Changed

Many things have changed in this version. Many of the main ideas such as frames,
processors, services and transports are still there but some things have changed
a bit.

- `Frame`s describe the basic units for processing. For example, text, image or
  audio frames. Or control frames to indicate a user has started or stopped
  speaking.

- `FrameProcessor`s process frames (e.g. they convert a `TextFrame` to an
  `ImageRawFrame`) and push new frames downstream or upstream to their linked
  peers.

- `FrameProcessor`s can be linked together. The easiest wait is to use the
  `Pipeline` which is a container for processors. Linking processors allow
  frames to travel upstream or downstream easily.

- `Transport`s are a way to send or receive frames. There can be local
  transports (e.g. local audio or native apps), network transports
  (e.g. websocket) or service transports (e.g. https://daily.co).

- `Pipeline`s are just a processor container for other processors.

- A `PipelineTask` know how to run a pipeline.

- A `PipelineRunner` can run one or more tasks and it is also used, for example,
  to capture Ctrl-C from the user.

## [0.0.8] - 2024-04-11

### Added

- Added `FireworksLLMService`.

- Added `InterimTranscriptionFrame` and enable interim results in
  `DailyTransport` transcriptions.

### Changed

- `FalImageGenService` now uses new `fal_client` package.

### Fixed

- `FalImageGenService`: use `asyncio.to_thread` to not block main loop when
  generating images.

- Allow `TranscriptionFrame` after an end frame (transcriptions can be delayed
  and received after `UserStoppedSpeakingFrame`).

## [0.0.7] - 2024-04-10

### Added

- Add `use_cpu` argument to `MoondreamService`.

## [0.0.6] - 2024-04-10

### Added

- Added `FalImageGenService.InputParams`.

- Added `URLImageFrame` and `UserImageFrame`.

- Added `UserImageRequestFrame` and allow requesting an image from a participant.

- Added base `VisionService` and `MoondreamService`

### Changed

- Don't pass `image_size` to `ImageGenService`, images should have their own size.

- `ImageFrame` now receives a tuple`(width,height)` to specify the size.

- `on_first_other_participant_joined` now gets a participant argument.

### Fixed
